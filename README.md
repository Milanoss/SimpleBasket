I want to say thank you to all in this thread so here is small present for you. Hopefully you will enjoy.
I created new basket indicator (like Basket indi) which has few advantages:
No problems with graph refreshing, all bars are loaded correctly now, not necessary to close/ open terminal
Weight of pairs is counted based on your currency, no *100 for non JPY pairs
This way you can simply check move of your basket by Crosshair, simply click and move and second number is move in your currency
Only one graph is open for basket, indicator is in Offline chart
Others will follow ;)
Installation:
Open any chart
Double click on indicator and click OK
If you haven't history dowloaded wait until 'Loading history data ...' message disappear
Close chart
Open OFFLINE chart
Double click on indicator and enter same configuration as with first graph!!
Save graph as template
